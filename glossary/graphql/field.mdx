import { GlossaryExternalLink } from "@/components/glossary-external-link"

A unit of data that belongs to a `type` in a schema. Every GraphQL query or mutation requests one or more fields. This example has a `Person` type with three fields: `id`, `name`, and `age`. To mark a field as non-nullable, add an exclamation mark (`!`) after the type.

```graphql
type Person {
  id: ID!
  name: String
  age: Int
}
```
