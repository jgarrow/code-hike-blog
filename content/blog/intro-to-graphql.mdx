GraphQL is a query language and specification for APIs that aims to enable clients to request specific data. This specificity in requests promotes efficiency and flexibility in data retrieval.

GraphQL was developed by Facebook in 2012 and released as an open-source project in 2015. Since then, it has gained popularity as an alternative to REST APIs. In this post, we'll cover some of the basics of GraphQL and some best practices when consuming a GraphQL API from a frontend application.

<Callout>
  We'll be using the public Star Wars GraphQL API (SWAPI) in the examples here
  to demonstrate some of the concepts. You can find the [API documentation and
  GraphiQL playground here](https://graphql.org/swapi-graphql/).
</Callout>

## Schema Definition Language (SDL)

A GraphQL schema is a collection of types that define what the API can and can't do. If it's not in the schema, clients can't request it. Think of the schema as a menu at a restaurant. It has a list of all of the things you're allowed to order. If it's not on the menu, you can't order it.

The shape of the schema follows a specification syntax called the Schema Definition Language (SDL). This is the syntax that a GraphQL API's schema will ALWAYS take, regardless of what programming language the underlying API is written in or what third-party GraphQL libraries you may be using.

<CodeWithTooltips>

```js !code schema.graphql -cwn
// !pill[1:4] 6
// !pill[6:13]
// !tooltip[/type/] type
// !tooltip[/Starship/] type name
type Starship {
  // !pill[3:4] 5
  // !pill[7:8] 2
  id: ID!
  // !pill[3:6] 5
  // !pill[9:14] 2
  // !tooltip[/name/] field
  name: String
  // !pill[3:10] 5
  // !pill[13:21] 2
  // !pill[22] 4
  // !tooltip[/Mission/] scalar
  missions: [Mission]!
}
```

## !!tooltips type

`type` keyword

## !!tooltips type name

Type name -- written in PascalCase by convention

## !!tooltips field

Field name

## !!tooltips scalar

Field type

</CodeWithTooltips>

At its core, a schema is made up of object `types` that contain `fields`. The fields are the individual pieces of data that can be requested. Each <GlossaryTooltip term="field"><FieldTooltipContent /></GlossaryTooltip> has a `type` that defines what kind of data it is. The <GlossaryTooltip term="type"><TypeTooltipContent /></GlossaryTooltip> can be a <GlossaryTooltip term="scalar"><ScalarTooltipContent /></GlossaryTooltip> (like a string, number, or boolean), an object (another type in the schema), or a list of other types.

### Root fields

The entry points for a GraphQL API are called the "root" types. These are the top-level fields that define what can be accessed. In the Star Wars API, the root fields are `allFilms`, `allPeople`, `allPlanets`, `allSpecies`, and `allStarships`.

```js schema.graphql -cwn
// !pill[6:10]
type Query {
  allFilms: [Film]
  allPeople: [Person]
  allPlanets: [Planet]
  allSpecies: [Species]
  allStarships: [Starship]
}
```

With other types, the name of the type is arbitrary. But the root types, `Query` and `Mutation`, are special. They are the entry points for the API. The `Query` type is for read operations, and the `Mutation` type is for write operations. **Therefore, in order to make any requests to your API, a type of the name `Query` must be defined. Likewise, in order to make any changes to data with your API, a type of the name `Mutation` must be defined.**

### Descriptions

To provide more human-readable descriptions about your types and fields, you can add comments to your schema. In the SDL, comments are written inline with `""` or as a block description with triple quotes `"""` (similar to writing a code block with triple backticks in markdown syntax).

```graphql schema.graphql -cwn
"The Root mutation type"
type Mutation {
  "Create a new starship"
  createStarship(name: String!): Starship
  """
  Edit the name of a starship
  This is a longer comment to demonstrate syntax
  """
  editStarshipName(id: ID!, name: String!): Starship
}
```

## Demand-driven design

Now that we've established the syntax specification for writing a GraphQL schema, let's talk schema design. While there are many ways to skin a cat, one pattern that is commonly recommended is to design your GraphQL API with a demand-driven, or schema-first, approach. This means that your API is designed based on client needs rather than on the structure of your data. This approach reduces development time by allowing frontend and backend developers to work in parallel, and it ensures that the API is built with the client's needs at the forefront of the design.

As frontend developers, this is where we can have a big impact in the API development. By working closely with backend developers, we can help define what shape we want the data to be in and what fields we need to request. Essentially, we can work together to agree on what the schema should look like and then go our separate ways to develop the frontend and backend in parallel without needing to wait on each other -- as long as both stick to the agreed upon schema, frontend can mock results while backend is still in development, and backend can develop the API with confidence in knowing what the final shape of the data needs to be.

{/* ## The Graph

So, if we're thinking about the data the client needs rather than being governed by the underlying data structures, we start to think about our data as a objects (like planets in the galaxy) that have relationships with other objects (people that live on those planets).

If we think of each object as a `node` and each relationship as an `edge`, we can start to visualize our data as a graph. This is where the name "GraphQL" comes from -- it's a query language for traversing the "graph" of interconnected and related data.

In other words, a graph in GraphQL terms is an interconnected set of data represented by a schema. It encompasses the relationships between different data types and how they can be queried or mutated. You can read more about what GraphQL is in the [official documentation](https://graphql.com/learn/what-is-graphql/). */}

## Operations

When you're ready to make a request to a GraphQL API, you'll need to write an `operation`. There are 3 types of `operations` in a GraphQL schema: `query`, `mutation`, and `subscription`. A `query` is a read operation (think GET). A `mutation` is a write operation (think PUT, POST, or DELETE). And a `subscription` is a long-lived, real-time operation that "listens" for changes to the requested data and sends updates to the client as they occur without the need for the client to send off another request (think [WebSockets](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/WebSockets_API)).

<CodeWithTooltips>

```js !code -cwn
// !link[/GraphiQL playground/] https://graphql.org/swapi-graphql/?query=query%20GetPerson(%24id%3A%20ID!)%20%7B%0A%20%20person(id%3A%20%24id)%20%7B%0A%20%20%20%20id%0A%20%20%20%20name%0A%20%20%20%20birthYear%0A%20%20%20%20homeworld%20%7B%0A%20%20%20%20%20%20name%0A%20%20%20%20%7D%0A%20%20%7D%0A%7D&operationName=GetPerson&variables=%7B%0A%20%20%22id%22%3A%20%22cGVvcGxlOjE%22%0A%7D
// Try out this query in the GraphiQL playground
// !pill[1:5]
// !tooltip[/query/] operation type
// !pill[7:15] 2
// !tooltip[/GetPerson/] operation name
// !pill[17:19] 3
// !tooltip[/\$id/] variable
// !pill[22:24] 4
// !tooltip[/ID/] variable type
query GetPerson($id: ID!) {
  // !pill[10:12] 5
  // !tooltip[/id/] variable name
  // !pill[14:16] 3
  // !tooltip[/\$id/] variable passed to the operation
  person(id: $id) {
    id
    name
    birthYear
    homeworld {
      name
    }
  }
}
```

## !!tooltips operation type

Operation type -- either `query`, `mutation`, or `subscription`

## !!tooltips operation name

The name of the operation -- written in PascalCase by convention

## !!tooltips variable

Variable value the client will provide, prefixed with `$`. Think of this as a function argument. You get to decide what the name is (just don't forget the `$`!).

## !!tooltips variable type

Variable type, as defined by the schema

## !!tooltips variable name

Variable name, as defined by the schema

## !!tooltips variable passed to the operation

Variable provided by the client. Must match the name of the variable (with the `$`) in the operation.

</CodeWithTooltips>

## Sending a request from the client

Now that we have our query operation, let's try to fetch it from the browser instead of the GraphiQL playground. We can test this out straight from the [browser console](https://graphql.org/swapi-graphql/?query=query%20GetPerson(%24id%3A%20ID!)%20%7B%0A%20%20person(id%3A%20%24id)%20%7B%0A%20%20%20%20id%0A%20%20%20%20name%0A%20%20%20%20birthYear%0A%20%20%20%20homeworld%20%7B%0A%20%20%20%20%20%20name%0A%20%20%20%20%7D%0A%20%20%7D%0A%7D&operationName=GetPerson&variables=%7B%0A%20%20%22id%22%3A%20%22cGVvcGxlOjE%22%0A%7D) and use the `fetch` API.

By nature, ALL GraphQL requests are sent as POST requests. This is because the query is sent as a JSON object in the body of the request. The query itself is a string, and the variables are an object.

```js fetch-luke.js -cn
// !focus(1:23)
// !collapse(1:23)
const fetcher = fetch(
  "https://swapi-graphql.netlify.app/.netlify/functions/index",
  {
    // !pill[14:17] 2
    method: "POST",
    headers: {
      "Content-Type": "application/json",
    },
    body: JSON.stringify({
      // !mark(2:11)
      query: `
        query GetPerson($id: ID!) {
          person(id: $id) {
            id
            name
            birthYear
            homeworld {
              name
            }
          }
        }
      `,
      variables: {
        id: "cGVvcGxlOjE",
      },
    }),
  },
)

// !collapse(1:5) collapsed
async function fetchLuke() {
  const response = await fetcher
  const { data } = await response.json()
  console.log(data)
}

await fetchLuke()
```

Success! We've successfully fetched Luke Skywalker's data from the SWAPI GraphQL API from the browser 🎉

## What happens when you send a request?

Now that we know what shape our query should take, let's take a look at what happens once we send a request to the server.

  This video is from one of Apollo GraphQL's free courses, [Lift-off II:
  Resolvers](https://www.apollographql.com/tutorials/lift-off-part2/01-journey-of-a-graphql-query).
  While their material is focused on using Apollo's GraphQL libraries, their
  content is still a great resource for understanding GraphQL concepts and best
  practices. For you JavaScript folks, I'd recomment checking out their
  [fullstack series](https://www.apollographql.com/tutorials/lift-off-part1) or
  their [client-side
  course](https://www.apollographql.com/tutorials/client-side-graphql-react).

## Apollo Client

Now while we CAN make our requests with the native `fetch` API, there are lots of third party libraries out there that extend upon its capabilities by adding features like caching, error handling, etc. Apollo Client and React Query are two libraries that are used at SpringHealth to make requests to our GraphQL APIs. They both have their own strengths and weaknesses, so it's worth checking out both to see which one fits your needs best.

I've arbitrarily chosed to use Apollo Client for the rest of this post, but you can still take the concepts and apply them in React Query's "flavor". Just be sure to check out the [React Query docs](https://tanstack.com/query/latest/docs/framework/react/graphql) for more information.

We won't go over initial set up of Apollo Client here, as I'm operating under the assumption that it's already been set up in your repos here at SpringHealth.

import {
  Accordion,
  AccordionContent,
  AccordionItem,
  AccordionTrigger,
} from "@/components/ui/accordion"

<Accordion type="single" collapsible>
  <AccordionItem value="item-1" className="border-none [&>h3]:m-0" >
    <AccordionTrigger className="text-sm py-2 px-3 bg-sky-200 data-[state=open]:rounded-t data-[state=closed]:rounded m-0 ">Need a refresher on initial app setup with Apollo Client?</AccordionTrigger>
    <AccordionContent className="border border-sky-500 border-2 border-t-0 py-4 px-3 rounded-b [&>:first-child]:mt-0">
      
      In the root layout page of your app, you'll want to create an instance of `ApolloClient` and wrap your app in an `ApolloProvider` component. This will give your app access to the Apollo Client instance and allow you to make requests to your GraphQL API. Your app might look a bit different, but the Apollo Client set up should look something like this:

      ```tsx index.tsx -cn
      import React from "react"
      import { createRoot } from "react-dom/client"
      import GlobalStyles from "./styles"
      import Pages from "./pages"
      // !mark(1:6)
      import { ApolloClient, InMemoryCache, ApolloProvider } from "@apollo/client"

      const client = new ApolloClient({
        uri: "https://your-graphql-endpoint-here.com/",
        cache: new InMemoryCache(),
      });

      const root = createRoot(document.getElementById('root')!);

      // !mark(3,6)
      root.render(
      <React.StrictMode>
        <ApolloProvider client={client}>
          <GlobalStyles />
          <Pages />
        </ApolloProvider>
      </React.StrictMode>
      );
      ```

    </AccordionContent>

  </AccordionItem>
</Accordion>

## Codegen

Since we use TypeScript here at Springhealth, let's go over some types. Our client apps dont' know anything about our GraphQL schema and it would be a pain to manually write the types for every query and mutation we make. This is where codegen comes in. Codegen is a tool that generates TypeScript types based on your GraphQL schema and operations. This way, you can write your queries and mutations in a `.graphql` file and have the types generated for you. Plus, any time the schema is changed in the backend, you don't have to worry about manually updating all of your types. Let codegen do that for you.

At a high level, here's how it works:

1. Install necessary packages and set up a `generate` command in the `package.json` scripts to launch the Code Generator.
2. Create a configuration file that guides the codegen process. At its most basic, this specifies the path to the GraphQL schema, the files in our frontend app it should inspect for GraphQL operations, and where to output the necessary TypeScript types.
3. Run our codegen command.
4. Check out the types it generated for us!

We're not going to go through all of the steps to set up and run codegen here, but Apollo has a [step-by-step guide](https://www.apollographql.com/tutorials/client-side-graphql-react/05-codegen) you can follow. These steps use the `graphql-codegen` libraries, which are not specific to Apollo. You can use them with any GraphQL client implementation.

import { CodeWithTabs } from "@/components/code/code-with-tabs"

<Accordion type="single" collapsible>
  <AccordionItem value="item-1" className="border-none [&>h3]:m-0" >
    <AccordionTrigger className="text-sm py-2 px-3 bg-blue-400 data-[state=open]:rounded-t data-[state=closed]:rounded m-0 text-white">Want to see an example configuration of codegen?</AccordionTrigger>
    <AccordionContent className="border border-blue-400 border-2 border-t-0 py-4 px-3 rounded-b [&>:first-child]:mt-0 ">
      
      In the root of your repo, create a `codegen.ts` file and add the following configuration:

      <div className="h-[435px]">
        <CodeWithTabs>

        ```ts !!tabs codegen.ts -cn
        import { CodegenConfig } from "@graphql-codegen/cli";

        const config: CodegenConfig = {
          schema: "https://your-graphql-endpoint-here.com/", // your GraphQL server endpoint
          documents: ["src/**/*.tsx"], // where all of your queries and mutations in your app can be found
          generates: {
            // where to output the generated types
            "./src/__generated__/": {
              preset: "client",
              presetConfig: {
                gqlTagName: "gql", // optional, defaults to `graphql` (Apollo tends to use `gql`, though)
              },
            },
          }
          ignoreNoDocuments: true,
        };

        export default config;
        ```

        ```json !!tabs package.json -cn
        {
          "scripts": {
            "generate": "graphql-codegen"
          },
          "dependencies": {
            // ...other dependencies
            "@graphql-codegen/cli": "^5.0.2",
            "@graphql-codegen/client-preset": "^4.3.2",
            // ...other dependencies
          }
        }
        ```

        </CodeWithTabs>
      </div>

    </AccordionContent>

  </AccordionItem>
</Accordion>

## Sending a request with Apollo Client

With Apollo Client configured and our types generated, we can now make a request to our GraphQL API. Let's fetch Luke Skywalker's data from the SWAPI GraphQL API using Apollo Client.

<CodeWithTooltips>

```tsx !code profile.tsx -cn
import { Layout } from "../components"
import { useParams } from "react-router-dom"
import PersonDetail from "../components/person-detail"
// !focus(1:29)
import { useQuery } from "@apollo/client"
// !pill[10:12] 2
// !tooltip[/gql/] gql
import { gql } from "../__generated__/"

// !pill[20:22] 2
// !pill[7:16] 3
// !pill(2[19:27],3[16:24])
const GET_PERSON = gql(`
  query GetPerson($personId: ID!) {
    person(id: $personId) {
      id
      name
      birthYear
      eyeColor
      hairColor
      gender
      height
      mass
      skinColor
      species {
        name
      }
      homeworld {
        name
        diameter
        rotationPeriod
        orbitalPeriod
        gravity
        population
      }
    }
  }
`)

const Person = () => {
  const { personId = "" } = useParams()
  // !focus(1:3)
  // !pill[45:54] 3
  // !tooltip[/useQuery/] useQuery
  const { loading, error, data } = useQuery(GET_PERSON, {
    // !pill[18:25]
    variables: { personId },
  })

  if (error) return <p>Error: {error.message}</p>

  if (loading) return <p>Loading...</p>

  if (data) {
    return (
      <Layout>
        <PersonDetail person={data.person} />
      </Layout>
    )
  }
}

export default Person
```

## !!tooltips gql

  Autogenerated by codegen; named by `gqlTagName` in your codegen config.

## !!tooltips useQuery

The [`useQuery` hook](https://www.apollographql.com/docs/react/data/queries#executing-a-query) returns an object with three properties: `loading`, `error`, and `data`. `loading` is a boolean that indicates whether the request is still in progress. `error` is an object that contains information about any errors that occurred during the request. `data` is the response data from the server.

If your operation needs any variables, you can pass them in an object as the second argument to the `useQuery` hook.

</CodeWithTooltips>

Since we're using our generated `gql` function when creating our query, TypeScript will automatically infer the correct type of the resulting `data` response object from the `useQuery` hook without the need to explicitly tell `useQuery` what the response type should be.

<Callout>
  Don't forget to re-run your codegen command every time you make changes to
  your queries or mutations. This will ensure that your types are always up to
  date with your schema.
</Callout>

<Accordion type="single" collapsible>
  <AccordionItem value="item-2" className="border-non [&>h3]:m-0">
    <AccordionTrigger className="text-sm py-2 px-3 bg-blue-400 data-[state=open]:rounded-t data-[state=closed]:rounded m-0 text-white">
      <span>What's this gql function?</span>
    </AccordionTrigger>
    <AccordionContent className="border border-blue-400 border-2 border-t-0 py-4 px-3 rounded-b [&>:first-child]:mt-0 ">
      This `gql` function is autogenerated by `graphql-codegen`. In our codegen
      config, we renamed it from the default `graphql` to `gql` in the
      `gqlTagName` property. This is a common convention used by Apollo Client,
      but you can name it whatever you want. The `gql` function is a template
      tag function that parses the provided query string into an AST (abstract
      syntax tree) that Apollo Client can use to make requests to our GraphQL
      API.

## Fragments

This is the most basic example of making a request with Apollo Client. But what happens when we have a nested component that needs some data from the same query? We could pass the data down as props, but that can get messy. Instead, we can use <GlossaryTooltip term="fragments"><FragmentTooltipContent /></GlossaryTooltip> and colocate them with the components that need them. This way, we can keep our components clean and only request the data we need where we need it. This will help us avoid overfetching data and avoid unnecessary prop drilling or storing data in React context.

In the example below, we're creating a fragment that we're calling `PlanetDetails` that contains a few fields about that planet. `Planet` would be an existing type in our GraphQL schema. We can then use this fragment in our query to request the author data for each track.

```graphql -cwn
fragment PlanetDetails on Planet {
  name
  diameter
  rotationPeriod
  orbitalPeriod
  gravity
  population
}
```

To use our fragment, we use a triple period (`...`) syntax in an operation that needs the fragments fields (kind of like the spread operator in JavaScript). Let's take a look at how our query from our `Person` component would look with and without the fragment.

<Spotlight>

## !!steps With fragments

```graphql ! -can
query GetPerson($personId: ID!) {
  person(id: $personId) {
    id
    name
    birthYear
    homeworld {
      ...PlanetDetails
    }
  }
}
```

## !!steps Without fragments

```graphql ! -can
query GetPerson($personId: ID!) {
  person(id: $personId) {
    id
    name
    birthYear
    homeworld {
      name
      diameter
      rotationPeriod
      orbitalPeriod
      gravity
      population
    }
  }
}
```

</Spotlight>

## Colocating fragments

The beauty of GraphQL is that we can request what we want where we want it. We can take our fragments and colocate them alongside the components that actually need them. This way, we can keep our components clean and only request the data we need where we need it.

Say our `Person` profile page has some nested components that some of our queried data is needed in. We can break our query up into fragments and colocate them with the components that need them. This will help us to avoid any overfetching or unnecessary prop drilling.

Let's take the home world planet data out of our query and into a fragment for a `PlanetDetails` child component.

<CodeWithTabs>

```tsx !!tabs person.tsx  -cn
import React from "react"
import { Layout } from "../components"
import PlanetDetails from "../components/planet-details"
import { useParams } from "react-router-dom"
import { useQuery } from "@apollo/client"
import { gql } from "../__generated__"

// !mark(7)
const GET_PERSON = gql(`
  query GetPerson($id: ID!) {
    person(id: $id) {
      id
      name
      homeworld {
        ...PlanetDetails
      }
    }
  }   
`)

const Person = () => {
  const { personId = "" } = useParams()
  const { loading, error, data } = useQuery(GET_PERSON, {
    variables: { id: personId },
  })

  if (error) return <p>Error: {error.message}</p>

Since we're using codegen, we can use the `useFragment` hook it creates for us to get the data from our fragment, complete with the correct TypeScript types. If our parent page/component contains children whose fragments request some of the same data, we can still colocate all of those fragments the same way and the final query response will dedupe any duplicated fields for us. And if we peek in our network panel, we can see that our parent component is only ever making 1 request to the server, even though our code is structured in a way to give us the illusion that we're requesting the data exactly where we need to use it. This is the power of GraphQL and fragments. Colocation, less complex prop drilling and state management, and fewer queries fired off. 🎉

We could keep going deeper with fragments, but I think this is a good stopping point for now. If you're interested in learning more about fragments, I'd recommend checking out the [Apollo Client docs](https://www.apollographql.com/docs/react/data/fragments) and [GraphQL Codegen docs](https://the-guild.dev/blog/unleash-the-power-of-fragments-with-graphql-codegen) for more information. Just note that codegen makes the implementation of fragments a bit different than using Apollo Client with JavaScript than with TypeScript.

## Caching

For our last topic today, let's talk about caching. Apollo Client comes out-of-the-box with a normalized `InMemoryCache` in the browser. In practice, this allows Apollo Client to give back a response that it finds in the cache seemingly immediately after a request was made, all without ever actually sending a network request. This is because Apollo Client stores the data it receives in the cache and then checks the cache before making a request to the server. If the data is already in the cache, it will return that data instead of making a network request.

<Callout>
  The [Apollo Client
  docs](https://www.apollographql.com/docs/react/caching/overview/) have some
  great diagram visualizations of how their cache works, so I'd recommend
  checking those out if you're interested in learning more about how the cache
  works under the hood.
</Callout>

Let's walk through the Apollo Client's caching process, using this JSON as our example query response:

```json query-response.json -n
{
  "data": {
    "person": {
      // !mark(1:2)
      "__typename": "Person",
      "id": "cGVvcGxlOjE=",
      "name": "Luke Skywalker",
      "homeworld": {
        // !mark(1:2)
        "__typename": "Planet",
        "id": "cGxhbmV0czox",
        "name": "Tatooine"
      }
    }
  }
}
```

When a query response comes back from the server, the Apollo Client cache does the following:

1. Identifies objects in the query response, **identifying them by their `id` field**. If we want an object to be more easily cacheable (i.e. flat with the rest of the cache vs as a nested object), we want to add the `id` field to all of our object queries.

In our example, it will find 2 objects: a `Person` object with an `id` of `cGVvcGxlOjE=` and a `Planet` object with an `id` of `cGxhbmV0czox`.

2. Generates cache IDs for each object. By default, Apollo Client uses the `__typename` and `id` fields ( separated by a colon `:`) to generate a unique cache ID for each object.

The default cache IDs for our example objects would be `Person:cGVvcGxlOjE=` and `Planet:cGxhbmV0czox`.

3. Replaces object fields that contain other objects with references (via the generated cache ID) to those objects in the cache.

<Spotlight>

## !!steps Before reference replacement

```json ! -can
{
  "__typename": "Person",
  "id": "cGVvcGxlOjE=",
  "name": "Luke Skywalker",
  // !mark(1:5)
  "homeworld": {
    "__typename": "Planet",
    "id": "cGxhbmV0czox",
    "name": "Tatooine"
  }
}
```

## !!steps After reference replacement

```json ! -can
{
  "__typename": "Person",
  "id": "cGVvcGxlOjE=",
  "name": "Luke Skywalker",
  // !mark(1:3)
  "homeworld": {
    "__ref": "Planet:cGxhbmV0czox"
  }
}
```

</Spotlight>

4. Stores normalized objects in the cache's flat lookup table. If an incoming object has the same cache ID as an existing object in the cache, Apollo Client merges the fields of those objects. The incoming object overwrites the existing object's fields. Other fields that are not in the incoming object are left untouched.

<Callout>
  There is an [Apollo Client Devtools Chrome
  extension](https://chromewebstore.google.com/detail/apollo-client-devtools/jdkknkkbebbapilgoeccciglkfbmbnfm)
  that you can use to inspect the cache and see what and how the data is being
  cached. It's a useful tool when you're debugging cache issues or making
  improvements to your cache strategy.
</Callout>

## Updating the cache

While reading our data from the cache is ⚡️ fast ⚡️, sometimes it gets stale and we need to update it. There are a few ways that we can achieve this:

1. **Refetching**: We can refetch the data from the server. This is the simplest way to update the cache, but it's not always the most efficient since you're firing off another request. If we're updating a single object, we can use the `refetch` method on the `useQuery` hook. If we're updating multiple objects, we can use the `refetchQueries` option in the `useMutation` hook.

2. **Polling**: This is similar to refetching, but it's done at regular intervals. We can use the [`pollInterval` option](https://www.apollographql.com/docs/react/data/queries#polling) in the `useQuery` hook to set how often we want to poll the server for updated data.

3. **Manual cache updates**: We can also manually update the cache after a mutation completes via the [`update` option](https://www.apollographql.com/docs/react/data/mutations#mutationhookoptions-interface-update) on the `useMutation` hook. This is helpful in cases where we want to update the cache with the new data without refetching the entire query.

4. **Optimistic updates**: We can update the cache optimistically before the server responds. This is useful for when we're updating a single object. We can use the [`optimisticResponse` option](https://www.apollographql.com/docs/react/performance/optimistic-ui/) in the `useMutation` hook to update the cache with the new data before the server responds.

The Apollo docs recommending using a combination of both approaches: optimistically or manually updating to allow the UI to immediately reflect the change, and then refetch in the background to ensure the cache is up to date with the server. The UI is then only rerendered if there are differences between the local cache and refetched data.

For the sake of time, we'll only go over using the [`update` function option](https://www.apollographql.com/docs/react/data/mutations/#the-update-function) on the `useMutation` hook to manually update our cache. Be sure to check out the [docs](https://www.apollographql.com/docs/react/data/mutations/#options) for what other options are available to you.

The Star Wars API doesn't have any mutations that we can use, so we'll have to imagine that we're updating a planet's population.

## !!tooltips cache

The `cache` argument is the current state of our Apollo Client cache. This is what we'll use to read and write data to update the cache.

## !!tooltips data

`data` is the response data from our mutation. We'll use this data to update our cache.

## !!tooltips identify

`cache.identify` is a method that, given an object with a `__typename` and `id`, returns the cache ID for that object. This is what we'll use to identify the object we want to update in the cache.

## !!tooltips updateQuery

`cache.updateQuery` is a method that allows us to both read and write to the cache with a single method call. If you need to read data from one query in the cache and write to a different object in the cache, you might want to use `cache.readQuery` and `cache.writeQuery` instead. 

Check out the [Apollo docs](https://www.apollographql.com/docs/react/caching/cache-interaction/#using-updatequery-and-updatefragment) for more information on how to use these methods.

## !!tooltips updateFragment

`cache.updateFragment` is a method that allows us to both read and write to the cache with a single method call. If you need to read data from one query in the cache and write to a different object in the cache, you might want to use `cache.readFragment` and `cache.writeFragment` instead.

Check out the [Apollo docs](https://www.apollographql.com/docs/react/caching/cache-interaction/#using-updatequery-and-updatefragment) for more information on how to use these methods.

## !!tooltips modify

`cache.modify` is a method that enables you to directly modify the values of individual cached fields, or even delete fields entirely. **Note**: this method ignores any custom merge functions you might have set up for your cache. Instead, it directly overwrites the existing field value with the new value you provide. However, you can circumvent this by utilizing the `writeQuery` or `writeFragment` methods within the `modify` method.

Check out the [Apollo docs](https://www.apollographql.com/docs/react/caching/cache-interaction/#using-modify) for more information.
