GraphQL is a query language and specification for APIs that aims to enable clients to request specific data. This specificity in requests promotes efficiency and flexibility in data retrieval.

GraphQL was developed by Facebook in 2012 and released as an open-source project in 2015. Since then, it has gained popularity as an alternative to REST APIs. In this post, we'll cover some of the basics of GraphQL and some best practices when consuming a GraphQL API from a frontend application.

<Callout>
  We'll be using the public Star Wars GraphQL API (SWAPI) in the examples here
  to demonstrate some of the concepts. You can find the [API documentation and
  GraphiQL playground here](https://graphql.org/swapi-graphql/).

## Schema Definition Language (SDL)

<Scrolly>

## !! start

```js !code schema.graphql -cwn
// !pill[1:4] 6
// !pill[6:13]
// !tooltip[/type/] type
// !tooltip[/Starship/] type name
type Starship {
  // !pill[3:4] 5
  // !pill[7:8] 2
  id: ID!
  // !pill[3:6] 5
  // !pill[9:14] 2
  // !tooltip[/name/] field
  name: String
  // !pill[3:10] 5
  // !pill[13:21] 2
  // !pill[22] 4
  // !tooltip[/Mission/] scalar
  missions: [Mission]!
}
```
